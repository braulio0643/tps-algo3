Necesito ayuda con otro ejercicio:
In the first morning of every summer, when the first ray of sunlight breaks into the oak forest, Jayjay,
the flying squirrel, quickly climbs to the top of an oak tree in the forest. From there, he starts his
descent to the ground, and tries to gather as many acorns from the trees on his way down. Being a
flying squirrel, Jayjay can choose, at any moment, to climb down the tree trunk or to fly from one tree
to any other tree on his descending journey. However, he loses f feet of height every time he flies from
one tree to another.
Suppose the forest has t oak trees, and all the trees have the same height of h feet. Given the height
of every acorn on each tree, write a program to compute the maximal possible number of acorns Jayjay
can collect by choosing a tree to climb and descend as described.
Figure 2: Example of oak trees with acorns.
Figure 2 shows an example of t = 3
oak trees with three, six, and five acorns,
respectively. The white circles and grey
line indicate a path for Jayjay to col-
lect the maximal possible number of eight
acorns, assuming that the height he loses
for each flight is f = 2.
Input
The input consists of a line containing
the number c of datasets, followed by c
datasets, followed by a line containing the
number ‘0’.
The first line of each dataset contains
three integers, t, h, f , separated by a
blank. The first integer t is the number of
oak trees in the forest. The second integer
h is the height (in feet) of all the oak trees.
The third integer, f , is the height (in feet)
that Jayjay loses every time he flies from
one tree to another. You may assume that
1 ≤ t, h ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ f ≤ 500.
The first line of each dataset is fol-
lowed by t lines. The i-th line specifies the height of every acorn on the i-th tree. The line begins
with a non-negative integer a that specifies how many acorns the i-th tree has. Each of the following a
integers n indicates that an acorn is at height n on the i-th tree. The positive integers in each line are
sorted in ascending order, and repetitions are allowed. Thus, there can be more than one acorn at the
same height on the same tree. You can assume that 0 ≤ a ≤ 2000, for each i.
Output
The output consists of one line for each dataset. The c-th line contains one single integer, which is the
maximal possible number of acorns Jayjay can collect in one single descent for dataset c.
Note: The dataset below and Jayjay’s path to collect the maximal number of 8 acorns are shown in
Figure 2.

Que error tiene mi implementacion Bottom Up? Me pasan 8 de 10 casos de test, debe ser un error muy específico.
